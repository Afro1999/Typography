Owned by Comcast and founded on April 30 1912, Universal Pictures is a film production company that has probably produced one of your favourite films (although that was probably a while ago) and one of the "Big Five" in terms of film production studios. 

Despite its 100+ years of activity and the many updates/modernisations to the logo - the fundamentals have remained consistent throughout the studio's entire existence.
