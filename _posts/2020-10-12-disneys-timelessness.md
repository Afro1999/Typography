Disney, Disney, Disney - not a soul in the world doesn't know what Disney is... but I'll still tell you anyway (Otherwise, what am I here for?). *The* (Yes, 'The', so fancy) *Walt Disney Studios*, founded in 1923, is an American (Surprise, surprise) film and entertainment studio and a segment of the Walt Disney Company. Like Universal, it is part of the 'Big Five' major film studios - (FUN FACT: I'm pretty sure Disney owns all of your favourite film franchises now).
