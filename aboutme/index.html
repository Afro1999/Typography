	<!-- Cope and paste your favourite emoji from here: https://textfancy.com/emoji/ -->
	<p>My favourite emoji is &#128514; because who doesn't like to laugh? And besides, the laughing emoji is no.1 on everyone's frequently used emojis list on their phones. Don't lie.</p>

	<p>Although I can't read through a novel to save my life, I'm an avid reader of comic books ranging from Marvel to DC to Image comics and my favourite comic book series is <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/24396/the_amazing_spider-man_2018_-_present" target="blank">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></p>
