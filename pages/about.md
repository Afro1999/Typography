Greetings fellow human, my name is Malachi Martin and I am a Media, Journalism and Publishing Student at Oxford Brookes University. This is, as you can probably tell, my blog and I'd like to apologise in advance for my humour in my posts (I use it under duress).

TextStyles (title completely unrelated) is a blog that explores and analyses the typography used in film production logos as well as film logos itself because, well, I like film and stuff. Because of this, the logo I have made for the blog is a clapperboard - which is a recognisable device synonymous with filmmaking, providing assistance in synchronising picture and sound as well as to mark scenes and takes that have been filmed in a production. I believed it would be a fitting logo in regards to the blog's content.

In terms of the typography of the logo itself I used Courier New for the initials 'TS' (TextStyles), seeing as Courier New is the font used universally for film scripts. Again, my reasoning for this was that I thought it was fitting to the content.

Reason for the banner? I had to keep the theme synonymous.
