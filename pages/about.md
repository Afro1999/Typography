TextStyles (title completely unrelated) is a blog that explores and analyses the typography used in film production logos as well as film logos itself.

Hence this, the logo I have made for the blog is a clapperboard - which is a recognisable device synonymous with filmmaking, providing assistance in synchronising picture and sound as well as to mark scenes and takes that have been filmed in a production. I believed it would be a fitting logo in regards to the blog's content.

In terms of the typography of the logo itself I used Courier New for the initials 'TS' (TextStyles), seeing as Courier New is the font used universally for film scripts. Again, my reasoning for this was that I thought it was fitting to the content.
